Assignment 2 Duckhunt

1. I think I have drawn all the required images for this assignment.

2. Person(s) with whom I have collaborated or discussed the assignment with: none.

3. Hours spent on this assignment: 3

4. Additional comments: this is a very fun assignment, I am looking forward to doing the animation for this. 
Also, I wonder how when drawImage() is rendered in the canvas, it can trim the extra gray spaces 
around the small images from the png file.
