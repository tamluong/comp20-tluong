1. I think I have implemented all the aspects of the requirements.

2. Someone with whom I have collaborated with for this assignment: none.

3. Hours: 10.

4. Additional comments:
This assignment is probably the most intense ever since the beginning of the semester.

I googled a lot (both literally and in api sense!) and learnt a lot too.

I realized there are many more things that can be done with Google API, not just the map and there are lots of potential to explore.
